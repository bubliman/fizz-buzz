## Game
Fizz Buzz is a game for children to learn divisions. Players count from 1 and on every number divisible by 3 they say "Fizz" instead of the number. Same for 5, but with "Buzz".
## Task
Your task is to create a program that counts from 1 to 100. And follows the rules of Fizz Buzz, you can make a twist to them if u want. Use any language. Good luck.
## Notes
Used c++ for my solution, first version is very unoptimized. I will make it in less lines later.
